          <p>
            Our firm represents both individuals injured in motor vehicle
            accidents and the people who treat those injured individuals.
            If the insurance company has told you that your claim is under
            investigation, is unrelated to the accident, or they just won't
            call you back, call Martin W. Bordoley, P.C. today.

          <p>
            If you've been injured in a motor vehicle accident, first call 911
            then call us. Every year, thousands of people are injured in car
            accidents, truck accidents, and motorcycle accidents. These
            accidents result in injuries with a range of severity, such as back
            and neck injuries, broken bones, paralysis, and spinal cord injury.
            If you or a family member have been injured in a car accident, even
            if the accident was your fault, contact our firm for experienced
            accident lawyers today.

          <h4>Family Law</h4>
          <p>
            Divorce is never part of the plan when a marriage takes place, but
            sometimes it is the right path forward for the family. Often
            individuals with children are afraid to move forward because of the
            impact on their children.  Our firm's motto is "the better you do,
            the better your children will do." Whether you need to file for
            divorce or your spouse has already started the divorce process, or
            have a post-divorce problem, we have the knowledge and skill that
            you want and need.

          <h4>Debtor and Creditor Collections</h4>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                For Creditors: Collecting debts can be difficult in today's
                economy. One of the principle concerns is whether you've stepped
                over the line in going about the collection. Our firm's legal
                knowledge in this area goes a long way. We can aid in locating
                the debtor and collecting your unpaid balance.
              </li>
              <li>
                For Debtors: We know that you wanted to pay your debts, and
                wanted to pay them on time, but it is not always possible.
                Sometimes there just is not enough money to go around. If you
                find yourself in this position, knowing the law regarding debt
                collection can help you negotiate the best settlement with your
                creditors.  Even if you have a judgment against you, we may
                still be able to help settle your debts and end garnishments.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Estate Planning: Protecting the wealth and property that you
                have accumulated is important. Knowing who would get that wealth
                and property if you were to pass away is even more important.
                Our firm's experienced lawyers can help you protect what you
                have built.
              </li>
              <li>
                Guardianships: If you have a family member who can no longer
                care for themselves, whether due to age or an accident, we can
                help with the process of having a guardian appointed.
              </li>
              <li>
                After the death of a family member: When a loved one has passed,
                the last thing you want to think about is having to protect your
                interests. From helping to settle the estate to negotiating
                complex disagreements over inheritance, we will be there for
                you. We have experience easing the legal burdens that follow a
                death and can help you get through this tough time.

            People sometimes get involved in bad situations. Our firm handles
            all drinking and driving offences, civil infractions (tickets),
            misdemeanors, and felonies in all Courts.

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Employment Disputes Including Wage and Hour Cases</h4>
          <p>
            Being a salaried employee does not mean you are not entitled to
            overtime. The federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and similar
            state laws provide protections for most employees. Most people
            should be paid at least minimum wage plus one and a half times their
            normal rate for all hours worked over forty in a week. If you are
            not being paid overtime, your employer may be violating wage and
            hour employment laws.
