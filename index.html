             <b>For Creditors</b>: Collecting debts can be difficult in today's
            economy. One of the principle concerns is whether you've stepped
            over the line in going about the collection. Our firm's legal
            knowledge in this area goes a long way. We can aid in locating
            the debtor and collecting your unpaid balance.
            <br>
            <b>For Debtors</b>: We know that you wanted to pay your debts, and
            wanted to pay them on time, but it is not always possible.
            Sometimes there just is not enough money to go around. If you
            find yourself in this position, knowing the law regarding debt
            collection can help you negotiate the best settlement with your
            creditors.  Even if you have a judgment against you, we may
            still be able to help settle your debts and end garnishments.

            <b>Estate Planning</b>: Protecting the wealth and property that you

            Our firm's experienced lawyers can help you protect what you
            have built.
           <br>
            <b>Guardianships</b>: If you have a family member who can no longer

            help with the process of having a guardian appointed.
           <br>
            <b>After the death of a family member</b>: When a loved one has passed,
            the last thing you want to think about is having to protect your

            complex disagreements over inheritance, we will be there for
            you. We have experience easing the legal burdens that follow a
            death and can help you get through this tough time.

            Being a salaried employee does not mean you are not entitled to overtime. The federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and similar state laws provide protections for most employees. Most people should be paid at least minimum wage plus one and a half times their normal rate for all hours worked over forty in a week. If you are not being paid overtime, your employer may be violating wage and hour employment laws.
